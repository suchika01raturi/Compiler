-> The Hydrogen compiler takes a .hy source file and processes it in these stages:

Tokenizer: Breaks code into tokens.

Parser: Builds an AST, now supports arithmetic with precedence.

Code Generator: Converts AST to NASM assembly (Windows compatible).

-> Assembler & Linker:

NASM (Netwide Assembler)→ Takes the generated .asm file and converts it into an object file (.obj)

GCC (GNU COMPILER COLLECTION) → Takes the .obj file and links it with necessary libraries to produce a final Windows executable (.exe).

-> Execution: Runs the final .exe and prints output.
